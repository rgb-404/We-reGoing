# Egg Timer Project

A desktop application which sets timers for various different egg-cooking methods.


## Overview

You get to select from a variety of egg cooking methods which all have pre-set timers for your convenience. Once you start the timer, it'll present you with a live countdown feed for you to track, followed by an alarm once the timer has run out.
